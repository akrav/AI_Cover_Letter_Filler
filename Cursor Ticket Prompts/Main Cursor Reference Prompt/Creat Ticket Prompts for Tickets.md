For all the tickets in /Users/adam/Documents/GitHub/MCPJungle/Epics/Epic 1

I would like to make ticket prompts that direct an ai coder to reference certain files in this project. Make sure all the files referrenced are in this project and use this example ticket prompt to make other ticket prompts: /Users/adam/Documents/GitHub/MCPJungle/Cursor Ticket Prompts/Prompts/Epic 1/Sprint 1/Example TICKET-1001 Prompt.md

name tickets like this TICKET-101 Prompt

and make sure the ticket prompts are located in their respective sprint folder:
for example epic 1 sprint 1 ticket prompts should reference epic 1 sprint 1 tickets and should be placed in epic 1 sprint 1
