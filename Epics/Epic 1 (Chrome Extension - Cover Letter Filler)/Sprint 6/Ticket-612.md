## Outcome
- `Build Documentation/User Guide.md` and `Build Documentation/Release Notes.md`.

## Tests
- `tests/docs/sprint6/ticket-612/user_guide_checklist.md`: verify guide covers install -> approve -> export; includes screenshots placeholders.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Clear, step-by-step guide with troubleshooting; release notes summarize MVP scope.
