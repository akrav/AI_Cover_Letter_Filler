# TICKET-420 — DOCX writer + test harness

## What / Why
Write DOCX using the replacement engine output; create a harness to spot-check replaced fields.

## Outcome
- DOCX generated as a Blob/buffer; basic harness for inspection.

## Tests
- `tests/export/sprint4/ticket-420/docx_writer.spec.md`: template + values → DOCX; sample fields confirm replacement.

## Acceptance Criteria
- DOCX produced reliably; writer handles basic formatting.
