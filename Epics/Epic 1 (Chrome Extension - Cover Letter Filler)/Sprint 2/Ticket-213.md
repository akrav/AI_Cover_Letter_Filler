# TICKET-213 — Boot banner and connection hotkey

## What / Why
Show a small “assistant ready” boot banner in-page and add a hotkey to open/close the panel quickly.

## Outcome
- Banner with dismiss; hotkey listed in options.

## Tests
- `tests/extension/sprint2/ticket-213/boot_banner.spec.md`: banner renders/dismisses; hotkey toggles panel.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Banner does not overlap critical UI; hotkey configurable and persisted.
