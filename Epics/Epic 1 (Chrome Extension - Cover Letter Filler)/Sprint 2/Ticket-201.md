# TICKET-201 — MV3 manifest scaffold (stub)

## What / Why
Create a minimal MV3 `manifest.json` with only required fields to unblock dev. Split build scripts into a separate ticket.

## Outcome
- `/extension/manifest.json` (MV3) with minimal permissions and placeholders.

## Tests
- `tests/extension/sprint2/ticket-201/manifest.spec.md`: assert required MV3 fields exist.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Manifest includes action/background/content/options.
