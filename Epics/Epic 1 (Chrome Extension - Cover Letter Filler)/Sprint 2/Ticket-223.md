# TICKET-223 — Panel toggle and hotkey

## What / Why
Add show/hide toggle for the right-side panel and a configurable hotkey. Split from TICKET-209.

## Outcome
- Toggle state persisted in storage; hotkey documented in options.

## Tests
- `tests/extension/sprint2/ticket-223/panel_toggle.spec.md`: toggle on/off, hotkey works, persists per tab.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Toggle and hotkey function reliably without interfering with site shortcuts.
