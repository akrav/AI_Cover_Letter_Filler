# TICKET-110 — Export plan (DOCX/PDF) and folder workflow

## What / Why
Decide on libraries and flow for rendering DOCX/PDF and saving to a chosen folder with the right naming convention.

## Outcome
`Build Documentation/Export Plan.md` describing docx/pdf libs, filename formats, and Directory Picker steps.

## Tests
- Add `tests/docs/sprint1/ticket-110/export_examples.md` with example filenames and an evidence bundle outline.
- Include a decision table for Directory Picker vs downloads fallback.

## Acceptance Criteria
- DOCX and PDF libraries chosen; rendering pipeline noted.
- Naming: `<UserFirstName>'s <CompanyName> Cover Letter.{docx,pdf}`.
- Directory Picker flow and downloads fallback documented.
