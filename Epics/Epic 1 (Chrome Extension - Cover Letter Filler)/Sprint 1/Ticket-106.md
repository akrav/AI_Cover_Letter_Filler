# TICKET-106 — MV3 structure and build tooling decision

## What / Why
Pick the extension build scaffolding (Vite + TS), directory structure, and bundling strategy for content/background/options.

## Outcome
`Build Documentation/Extension Build.md` describing structure, scripts, and dev flow.

## Tests
- Add `tests/docs/sprint1/ticket-106/build_layout.md` outlining target folder structure and artifact names.
- Include a minimal manifest.json example validating MV3 fields.

## Acceptance Criteria
- MV3 layout decided (content, background, options).
- Build scripts (dev/build) documented.
- Notes on hot-reload/dev convenience included.
