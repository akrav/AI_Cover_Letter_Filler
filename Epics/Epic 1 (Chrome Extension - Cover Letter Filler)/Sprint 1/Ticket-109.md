# TICKET-109 — Approval UI spec (variable table layout)

## What / Why
Specify the extension UI for reviewing evidence and approving final fills per variable.

## Outcome
`Build Documentation/Approval UI Spec.md` with wireframe sketches (ASCII ok) and state transitions.

## Tests

- Include an error state example (missing evidence).

## Acceptance Criteria
- Columns: Variable | Quote | URL | Rationale | Draft | Final | Approve.
- Edit paths documented; error states (missing evidence) covered.
- Save/Export readiness indicator defined.
