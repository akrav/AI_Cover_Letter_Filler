# TICKET-103 — Style modeling rubric and descriptors

## What / Why
Create a concise rubric for capturing style (tone, cadence, structure, lexicon) and the JSON schema for `style_profile`.

## Outcome
`Build Documentation/Style Modeling Rubric.md` and a JSON schema snippet in the doc.

## Tests
- Add `tests/docs/sprint1/ticket-103/style_rubric_examples.md` with 2 short writing samples -> expected descriptors.
- Include a reference `style_profile.example.json` aligned to the schema.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Rubric covers tone, structure, lexicon, formatting.
- JSON schema for `style_profile` drafted and referenced by other docs.
- Linked in Sprint-Progress.md.
