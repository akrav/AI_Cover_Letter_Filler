# TICKET-513 — Accessibility focus order for approval table

## What / Why
Ensure logical keyboard focus order and focus outlines for all interactive elements in the approval table.

## Outcome
- Defined tab order; ARIA roles/labels clarified.

## Tests
- `tests/ui/sprint5/ticket-513/focus_order.spec.md`: keyboard-only traversal works end-to-end.

## Acceptance Criteria
- No focus traps; PASS basic WCAG AA for focus visibility.
